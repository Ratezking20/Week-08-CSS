            <p class="p-2"> Lesean Devonn grew up in the inner city of Minneapolis, MN thriving through the streets of the Northside, was surrounded by musical influence in the most important places. He always looked for inspiration in 
                the people around him to make great records along with his brother and cousin.
                <br><br> Eager to become successful as a Hip Hop artist, Lesean Devonn began to get a job to fund his music career where he a nearly lost his life.
                He had no idea if he would be able to sing or rap again, and was unsure about his future in music.
                With insult to injury, Lesean Devonn felt compelled to put his motivation to heal and get better into his music.<br><br> He wants fans to know that if they've fallen, that they can get back up and make things happen from seemingly impossible situations.
